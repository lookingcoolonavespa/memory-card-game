## what is it?
- test your memory in this game
- you can only select a card once per level! 
- the game keeps track of your high score so you can compare with how you're doing
- features a cool card flipping animation

## project goals
- get familiar with useEffect

## tech stack
- react
- react-spring
- js
- html/css

## challenges i faced
- **Figuring out animations** - I decided to use react-spring to handle animations because I felt it made the code easier to read. Took a couple hours to figure out how to make it work the way I wanted it to.
- **Getting all the cards to load at the same time** - I hadn't used promise.all before this project all that often, so this was some well needed practice.
